# Twitter Unfollower Bot
Unfollow people who do not follow you back

# Why do you need this?
You can run this script to bulk unfollow people who do not follow you back. Since this is your own script, once it's on a server, you can always go back to that link and use it again.

# Usage
1. Go to http://apps.twitter.com
2. Click on 'Create New App'
3. Enter name, description, website. Make sure your account is verified using a mobile phone number.
4. And click submit.

After the app is created, click on 'manage keys and access tokens'.

Copy:
1. Consumer Key (API Key)
2. Consumer Secret (API Secret)

Click on 'Create my Access Token' and Copy:
1. Access Token
2. Access Token Secret

Once you have these 4 keys, put them in the index.php file and run it on a server. You'll start unfollowing people who do not follow you back.
